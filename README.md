## Task Overview
This project proposes the design and algorithm of a robot that automates a food storage warehouse, minimizing human intervention.  
The system focuses on **task scheduling, navigation, and material handling** within defined operational zones.



## Algorithm
1.	**Define the Working Area :** <br>
    •	Determine warehouse dimensions (length × width × height)<br>
	•	Create a detailed map of shelves, aisles, and loading/unloading zones
  	
2.	**Define the Working Envelope :** <br> 
	•	The working envelope is the area the robot can access while performing tasks <br>
	•	Includes all shelves and aisles accessible to the robot

3.	**Define the Operation Envelope :** <br> 
	•	The operation envelope is the range of the robotic arm during handling operations <br>
	•	Must cover full shelf heights and floor-level loading zones

4.	**Identify Dead Zones :** <br> 
	•	Areas the robot cannot reach due to design or dimensional constraints <br>
	•	Example: tight corners, under fixed equipment, or above certain heights

5.	**Design Robot Movement & Tasks :** <br> 
	•	Navigate the robot between storage and receiving locations <br>
	•	Use sensors to avoid collisions and locate shelves accurately <br>
    •	Robotic arm lifts, transports, and places products in their locations

6.	**Define Shape & Dimensions :** <br> 
	•	Low and wide base for stability <br>
	•	Robotic arm capable of movement in three directions (X, Y, Z) <br>
    •	Wheels or guided track depending on warehouse layout
  	
---  	
## Robot Design
	•	Base: Equipped with wheels or track system for movement.
	•	Robotic Arm: For lifting and placing products.
	•	Sensors: For collision avoidance and accurate positioning.
	•	Control System: To control movements and execute tasks.
	•	Power Supply: Rechargeable battery or fixed power source.
	•	Communication Module: To communicate with warehouse management system.

## Working Envelope & Dead Zones

**Working Envelope:** Entire warehouse area accessible for robot movement and product handling<br>
**Operation Envelope:** Space covered by the robotic arm while working on shelves, including vertical and horizontal reach<br>
**Dead Zone:** Areas under or behind obstacles, tight corners, or heights unreachable by the arm
