# Automated Warehouse Robot Project

## 1. Introduction
This project proposes the design and algorithm of a robot that automates a food storage warehouse, minimizing human intervention.  
The system focuses on **task scheduling, navigation, and material handling** within defined operational zones.

## 2. Execution Algorithm (Pseudocode)

```pseudo
Start
  Initialize robot sensors and navigation system
  Load warehouse map and define working area
  Define working envelope, operation envelope, and dead zones

  While warehouse is active:
      Receive storage or retrieval requests
      Check task priority and scheduling
      Plan optimal path avoiding dead zones
      Move to target shelf or location
      Pick or place food item
      Update inventory database
      Return to standby zone
End

3. Workspace Definitions
	•	Working Area: The total floor space of the warehouse, including shelves, aisles, and pathways.
	•	Working Envelope: The 3D space that the robot can physically reach with its arms or movement.
	•	Operation Envelope: The practical zone within the working envelope where the robot can safely and effectively perform tasks.
	•	Dead Zone: Areas inside the warehouse that the robot cannot reach due to physical limitations or obstacles (e.g., blind spots, corners).

4. Robot Design
	•	Base: Mobile wheeled platform for navigating warehouse aisles.
	•	Manipulator Arm: 6-DOF robotic arm mounted on top of the base.
	•	End Effector: Adaptive gripper to handle boxes and packages.
	•	Sensors: LIDAR + Camera for navigation and obstacle detection.
	•	Controller: Embedded microcontroller (e.g., Arduino + ROS integration).
	•	Power Supply: Rechargeable battery pack.
